**Technologies:** Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS <br> 
**Libraries:** Flask, NLTK, Heapq <br>
**Description:** This is a web application that utilizes Python's Flask library and JavaScript's Ajax call to send user inputted text from the client-side to the server-side where the NLTK library is then used to tokenize the text, assign rankings for each sentence, and generate an extractive summary from the top *n* ranked sentences (available in 5 different languages). To run this project download the files and run app.py. This will showcase a local host link in the terminal and by clicking this the website will load as intended.
